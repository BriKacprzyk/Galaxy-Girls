		<h1>Congratulations on becoming a member!</h1>
		<p>With membership comes the hope that you will be commited to this group and try to attend most of our meetings. If this group ends up not being your thing just let the moderator, Bridget, know. That way she can remove you from the group chat on Facebook.</p>
		<p>The group chat link is <a class="link" href="#">here.</a></p>
		<p>At some point in between meet sessions the moderator will post a poll to figure out what everyone is interested in doing for the next meet.</p>
